## Introduction to JavaScript
---
:::note
- JavaScript is a high-level, **interpreted** programming language that conforms to the [ECMAScript specification](https://ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/). 
- JavaScript has **curly-bracket** syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based and class-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
- JavaScript **borrows** most of its syntax from Java, C, and C++, but it has also been influenced by Awk, Perl, and Python.

## Adding JavaScript to an HTML Document
---
You can add JavaScript in **three ways**: internal/embedded, external, and inline.

:::tip
- To add JavaScript to an HTML document, you can use the `<script>` HTML element. 
:::

### 1. Inline JavaScript
---

You can add JavaScript directly within an HTML element using the `onclick`, `onmouseover`, and other **event attributes**.

```html
<button onclick="console.log('Hello, World!')"> Click Me </button>
```
- The JavaScript statement(s) run when the event (e.g., `onclick`) is triggered.

### 2. Internal JavaScript 
---

You can also write JavaScript inside the `<script>` tags, usually placed in the `<head>` or just before the closing `</body>` tag. This is the most common approach for adding JavaScript directly to an HTML document.

#### Inside `<head>`:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Internal JavaScript Example</title>
    <script>
        // This is the JavaScript code
        function showMessage() {
            alert('Hello from internal JavaScript!');
        }
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    <button onclick="showMessage()">Click me</button>
</body>
</html>
```


### 3. External JavaScript
---
- It's common to place JavaScript in **a separate file** and link it to your HTML. This makes your code more organized and reusable.
- This is the **cleanest** and **most efficient** method for adding JavaScript to a webpage, especially for larger projects.

:::tip[Steps:]
1. Create a `.js` file (e.g., `main.js`).
2. Link the `.js` file to your HTML file using the `<script>` element and the `src` attribute.
:::

```html title="Example: Linking an External JavaScript File"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>External JavaScript Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <button onclick="showMessage()">Click me</button>

    <!-- Linking the external JavaScript file -->
    <script src="script.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

```javascript title="script.js"
// script.js
function showMessage() {
    alert('Hello from external JavaScript!');
}
```

### When to Use Each Method?
---
- **Inline JavaScript**: Use for **simple interactions** tied to specific elements (small snippets).
- **Internal JavaScript**: Ideal for small-to-medium projects or when you don't want to manage multiple files.
- **External JavaScript**: Best for larger projects for maintainability and separation of concerns.

### Best Practices for Adding JavaScript
---
:::note[Note:]
1. **Place `<script>` tags just before `</body>` for faster page loading**: 
    - This ensures that the DOM (HTML structure) is **fully loaded** before your JavaScript runs. 
    - This also helps prevent issues where JavaScript tries to interact with elements that haven't been rendered yet.
  
2. **Use `defer` attribute for external scripts**: 
    - If you prefer to include your external JavaScript file in the `<head>`, then use the **`defer`** attribute to ensure it runs after the HTML is parsed.
    - Using `defer` the script is executed after the HTML document is fully parsed.

   ```html title="Example: Using defer attribute"
   <script src="script.js" type="text/javascript" defer></script>
   ```
3. **Use `async` attribute for non-blocking scripts**: 
    - Script is fetched and executed asynchronously (without blocking HTML parsing).
    - If the script doesn't depend on the DOM, you can use the **`async`**  attribute to load it asynchronously.    

    ```html title="Example: Using async attribute"
    <script src="script.js" type="text/javascript" async></script>
    ```
