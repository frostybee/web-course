### **2. Data Types**

JavaScript is a **dynamically typed** language, meaning the type of a variable is determined at runtime.

There are **primitives** and **reference** types in JavaScript:

- **Primitive types**: 
  - `String`: Represents a sequence of characters.
  - `Number`: Represents both **integer** and **floating-point** numbers.
  - `Boolean`: Represents a true or false value.
  - `Undefined`: Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
  - `Null`: Represents a non-existent or invalid value.
  - `Symbol` (ES6, 2015): A unique identifier.
  - `BigInt` (ES11, 2020): Represents integers that are too large for the `Number` type.

- **Objects**: More complex types like arrays, functions, and regular objects.
