## Intro to JavaScript
:::tip[Note]
- JavaScript is a **dynamically typed** language, meaning that variables can hold values of any type without explicit declaration.
:::

## What Are Variables in JS? 
- in JavaScript, variables are containers for storing data values .
- They allow you to name and **reuse values** (e.g., numbers, strings, booleans, objects) throughout your code.

## Declaring Variables
---
JavaScript offers **three keywords** for declaring variables: `var`, `let`, and `const`. Each has **distinct behavior**.

### 1. `var` (Legacy)
- The traditional way to declare variables. It has function scope or global scope if declared outside a function.
- Variables declared with `var` can be **redeclared** and **reassigned**.  

```javascript title="Example: Declaring variables with var" 
var name = "Alex";
var name = "Sam"; // Redeclaration OK
name = "Jess";    // Reassignment OK
console.log(name); // "Jess"
```
- **Issue**: Hoisting (moved to top of scope) can lead to bugs.
```javascript
console.log(x); // undefined (not an error!)
var x = 5;
```

### 2. `let` (Modern)
- Introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6, 2015).
- Block-scoped, can be reassigned but **not redeclared** in the same scope.
- **`let`** provides better control over variable scoping compared to `var`

```javascript title="Example: Declaring variables with let"
let age = 25;
age = 26;         // OK
let age = 30;     // Error: Cannot redeclare
console.log(age); // 26
```

### 3. `const` (Modern)
- Also introduced in ES6, **`const`** is used to declare variables that cannot be reassigned or redeclared after their initial value has been set.  
- **`const`** is block-scoped, 

:::note
- Objects/arrays `const` variables hold **can be mutated**.
:::

```javascript title="Example: Declaring variables with const" 
const pi = 3.14;
pi = 3.15;        // Error: Assignment to constant
const person = { name: "Alex" };
person.name = "Sam"; // OK (object mutation)
console.log(person.name); // "Sam"
```
:::tip[Note]
- Use **`let`** for variables that change.
- Use **`const`** for values that won’t be reassigned.
- Avoid **`var`** unless working with legacy code.
:::

## Variable Assignment

Variables are assigned values using the `=` operator.

```javascript title="Example: Assigning value to a JS variable"
let name = "Josée"; // Assign a string to 'name'
name = "Bob"; // Reassign the value of "Bob" to 'name'
```

- For **`const`** variables, the value must be assigned during declaration and cannot be reassigned afterward.


## Scope
Scope determines where a variable is accessible.

#### **Global Scope**
- Declared outside functions, accessible everywhere.
```javascript
let globalVar = "I'm everywhere";
function logIt() {
    console.log(globalVar); // "I’m everywhere"
}
logIt();
```

#### **Function Scope (var)**
- `var` is limited to the function it's declared in.
```javascript
function test() {
    var localVar = "I'm local";
    console.log(localVar); // "I’m local"
}
test();
console.log(localVar); // Error: localVar is not defined
```

#### **Block Scope (let, const)**
- `let` and `const` are limited to `{}` blocks (e.g., `if`, `for`).
```javascript
if (true) {
    let blockVar = "I'm trapped";
    console.log(blockVar); // "I’m trapped"
}
console.log(blockVar); // Error: blockVar is not defined
```
