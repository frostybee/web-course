## Intro to JavaScript
JavaScript is a **dynamically typed** language, meaning that variables can hold values of any type without explicit declaration.

## What Are Variables in JS? 
- Variables are containers for storing data in JavaScript.
- They allow you to name and **reuse values** (e.g., numbers, strings, booleans, objects) throughout your code.
