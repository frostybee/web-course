## What Are Objects in JavaScript?

- JavaScript objects **are collections** of **key-value pairs**, where the keys are strings (or Symbols) and the values can be **any** JavaScript **data type**, including other objects. 
- Think of objects as containers that hold related data and functionality.

:::note[Note]
Unlike arrays, which use **numeric indices**, objects use **named properties**, making them ideal for representing real-world entities with multiple characteristics.
