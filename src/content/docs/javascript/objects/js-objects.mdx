## What Are Objects in JavaScript?
---
:::note
- JavaScript objects **are collections** of **key-value pairs**, where the keys are **strings** (or **Symbols**) and the values can be **any** JavaScript **data type**, including other objects. 
- Think of objects as containers that hold related data and functionality.
:::

:::tip[Tip]
- Unlike arrays, which use **numeric indices**, objects use **named properties**, making them ideal for representing real-world entities with **multiple characteristics**.
:::

```javascript title="Example of a JavaScript object representing a book:"
const book = {
  title: "JavaScript: The Good Parts",
  author: "Douglas Crockford",
  yearPublished: 2008,
  pages: 176,
  isInPrint: true
};
```

## Creating Objects
---

There are several ways to create objects in JavaScript:

### 1. Object Literals
---

The **most common** way to create objects is using object literal notation:

```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 30
};
```

#### Nested Objects

Objects can contain other objects as properties, creating a nested structure.

```javascript
let person = {
  name: 'Alice',
  address: {
    street: '123 Main St',
    city: 'Wonderland'
  }
};

console.log(person.address.city); // Output: Wonderland
```

### 2. Using ES6 Classes
---
ES6 (2015) introduced **class syntax**, which provides a more familiar way to create objects for programmers coming from class-based languages:

```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(firstName, lastName, age) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
    this.age = age;
  }
  
  getFullName() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  }
}

const john = new Person("John", "Doe", 30);
console.log(john.getFullName()); // "John Doe"
```
:::tip[Tip]
It's important to understand that classes in JavaScript are primarily syntactic sugar over the prototype-based inheritance mechanism. They don't fundamentally change how objects work.
:::

### 3. Constructor Functions
---
Constructor functions let you create multiple objects **with the same structure**:

```javascript
function Person(firstName, lastName, age) {
  this.firstName = firstName;
  this.lastName = lastName;
  this.age = age;
}

const john = new Person("John", "Doe", 30);
const jane = new Person("Jane", "Smith", 25);
```

:::note[Note]
When you use the **`new`** keyword with a **constructor function**, JavaScript:
1. Creates a new empty object
2. Sets `this` inside the function to refer to that new object
3. Executes the function code, which typically adds properties to the object
4. Returns the object (unless the function explicitly returns something else)
:::

## Working with Object Properties

### Accessing Properties
You can access object properties in two ways:
#### Dot Notation

- **Syntax:** `objectName.propertyName`

```javascript
const person = { name: "John", age: 30 };
console.log(person.name); // "John"
person.age = 31;
```

#### Bracket Notation

- **Syntax:** `object["property"]`

```javascript title="Example of using bracket notation with a variable:"
const propertyName = "name";
console.log(person[propertyName]); // "John"

// Adding a property with spaces in its name
person["favorite color"] = "blue";
```
:::tip
**Bracket notation** is particularly useful for **dynamic property** names, when:
- The property name includes **spaces** or **special characters**,
- The property name is stored in a variable,
- The property name is determined at runtime.
:::

#### Destructuring Objects

ES6 introduced **destructuring** to **extract properties** into variables.

```javascript
const user = { name: "Eve", age: 28 };
const { name, age } = user;
console.log(name, age); // "Eve", 28

// With aliasing
const { name: userName } = user;
console.log(userName); // "Eve"
```

### Adding and Modifying Properties
Properties can be added or updated after creation.

```javascript
const person = { name: "Charlie" };
person.age = 30;              // Add
person.name = "Charlotte";    // Modify
```

### Deleting Properties
Use the `delete` operator to remove a property.

```javascript
delete person.age;
console.log(person.age); // undefined
```

### Property Existence Checking

To check if a property exists in an object, you can use:

#### The `in` operator:

```javascript
console.log("make" in car); // true
console.log("model" in car); // false after deletion
```

#### hasOwnProperty() method:

```javascript
console.log(car.hasOwnProperty("make")); // true
```

Unlike the `in` operator, `hasOwnProperty()` only checks for the object's own properties, not properties inherited from its prototype.

#### Comparing with undefined:

```javascript
console.log(car.model === undefined); // true if the property doesn't exist
```
:::danger[Tip]
This approach has a limitation: if a property exists but is explicitly set to `undefined`, this check will give a false positive for non-existence.
:::

## Object Methods

Methods are functions stored as object properties. They allow objects to have behavior in addition to data.

```javascript
const dog = {
  name: "Rex",
  bark() {
    console.log(`${this.name} says woof!`);
  }
};

dog.bark(); // "Rex says woof!"
```

- **Shorthand Method Syntax**: ES6 allows omitting the `function` keyword.



### Extending Classes
Use `extends` for inheritance in ES6 classes.

```javascript
class Vehicle {
  constructor(type) {
    this.type = type;
  }
  move() {
    console.log(`${this.type} is moving`);
  }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
  constructor(make, model) {
    super("Car"); // Call parent constructor
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
  }
}

const myCar = new Car("Hyundai", "Sonata");
myCar.move(); // "Car is moving"
```
