## What Are Events?

:::note
- Events are **actions** or **occurrences** that happen in the browser, such as a user clicking a button, typing in a form, or the page finishing loading.
- JavaScript allows developers to **listen** for and **respond** to various **user actions** or **other events**, such as clicks, mouse movements, key presses, or page loading. 
- This is done using **event listeners (or handlers)**, which are functions that **are executed** when a specific event occurs.
- Events are a core part of JavaScript programming, enabling developers to create **interactive** and **dynamic** web applications.
:::


### Types of Events
Here are some common event types:
- **Mouse events**: Click, mouseover, mouseout, mousedown, mouseup, etc.
- **Keyboard events**: keydown, keyup, keypress
- **Form events**: submit, change, input, focus, blur
- **Document events**: load, DOMContentLoaded, resize, scroll
- **Media events**: play, pause, ended, volumechange
- **Other events**: touch events, focus, and blur events

:::tip
Each event represents a state change in the browser or user interface.

## Event Handlers: What Are They?
---
:::note
An **event handler** is a function that gets called when a specified event occurs. It's a **callback function** that you associate with a particular event on an HTML element or a JavaScript object.
:::

## Adding Event Listeners
---
There are three main ways to add **event handlers** to an element in JavaScript:

### 1. Inline Event Handler 
---
Inline event handling involves **adding** event handler code directly to HTML elements as **event attributes**. This approach is generally **not recommended** due to maintainability issues.

```html
<button onclick="alert('Button clicked!')">Click Me</button>
```

### 2. Using the `onclick` Property 
---
- This method allows setting **a function** as an **event handler** for an element. 
- If there is already an event handler assigned using `onclick`, it **will be overwritten** by a new one.

```javascript
const button = document.querySelector("button");
button.onclick = function() {
  alert("Button clicked!");
};
```

### 3. Using the `addEventListener()` 
---
:::danger[Note]
- The `addEventListener()` method is the **preferred modern approach** for attaching event handlers. 
- It offers more flexibility and allows **multiple event listeners** for the same event type.
:::

**Syntax:**
```javascript
element.addEventListener(event, function, useCapture);
```

- `event`: The name of the event (e.g., "click", "keydown").
- `function`: The callback function to be executed when the event occurs.
- `useCapture` (optional): A boolean that specifies whether the event should **be captured** during the capturing phase (`true`) or the bubbling phase (`false`, default).


**Example:** of using `addEventListener` to handle a button click event:

```javascript 
const element = document.getElementById("elementId");
element.addEventListener("click", function() {
  alert("Element clicked!");
});
```
## How `addEventListener()` Works?
---
1. **`element`**: This refers to a specific DOM (Document Object Model) element on the web page, like a button, a div, or any HTML element you can interact with. You would typically get this element using methods like `document.getElementById()`, `document.querySelector()`, etc.

2. **`addEventListener`**: This is a method that attaches an event handler (a function) to the specified element. It listens for an event (like a mouse click, key press, etc.) and runs a function when that event happens.

3. **`'event'`**: This is a string that specifies the type of event you're listening for. Common events include:
   - `'click'`: Triggered when the element is clicked.
   - `'mouseover'`: Triggered when the mouse pointer is over the element.
   - `'keydown'`: Triggered when a key is pressed down.
   - `'submit'`: Triggered when a form is submitted.

4. **`function`**: This is the **callback function** that will run when the event occurs. The function contains the code you want to execute when the event is triggered. It **can be an anonymous** function, like:
   ```js
   function() {
       console.log("Element clicked!");
   }
   ```
   Or a named function, like:
   ```js
   function handleClick() {
       console.log("Element clicked!");
   }
   ```

## Removing Event Listeners
To remove an event listener, you can use the `removeEventListener()` method. This is useful for cleaning up or detaching events when they're no longer needed.

```javascript
const button = document.querySelector("button");

function clickHandler() {
  alert("Button clicked!");
}

button.addEventListener("click", clickHandler);
button.removeEventListener("click", clickHandler);
```

## Event Propagation
Events in JavaScript can propagate in two phases:

### 1. Capturing Phase
Before bubbling, events go from the root down to the target element:

```
root → ... → grandparent → parent → element
```
You can control which phase the event listener will be active in by setting the `useCapture`, the third parameter of addEventListener:

```javascript
element.addEventListener('click', handler, true); // true enables capturing phase
// Or with the options object syntax:
element.addEventListener('click', handler, { capture: true });
```

### 2. Bubbling Phase
The event bubbles back up from the target element to the outermost element.
By default, events "bubble" up from the target element to the root of the document:

```
element → parent → grandparent → ... → root
```
You can prevent this bubbling behavior by using `event.stopPropagation()` in your event handler.



## The Event Object
---
When an event is triggered, an **event object** is automatically passed to the event handler function. This object contains useful information about the event, such as the target element, the type of event, and other details.

```javascript
button.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
    console.log(event); // The event object
    console.log(event.type); // "click"
    console.log(event.target); // The element that triggered the event
});
```

### Common Event Object Properties

- **`event.type`**: The type of event (e.g., "click", "keydown")
- **`event.target`**: The element that triggered the event
- **`event.currentTarget`**: The element that the event handler is attached to
- **`event.timeStamp`**: The time when the event occurred
- **`event.bubbles`**: Boolean indicating if the event bubbles up the DOM tree
- **`event.cancelable`**: Boolean indicating if the event can be canceled
- **`event.defaultPrevented`**: Boolean indicating if `preventDefault()` has been called

**Event-specific properties:**
- **Mouse events**: clientX, clientY, pageX, pageY, screenX, screenY, button, buttons, altKey, ctrlKey, shiftKey, metaKey
- **Keyboard events**: key, code, keyCode (deprecated), altKey, ctrlKey, shiftKey, metaKey
- **Form events**: Form elements often include properties like value, checked, selected, etc.

### Common Event Object Methods

- **event.preventDefault()**: Prevents the default browser behavior for the event
- **event.stopPropagation()**: Stops the event from bubbling up the DOM tree
- **event.stopImmediatePropagation()**: Stops both bubbling and prevents other handlers on the same element


### `preventDefault()` and `stopPropagation()`
- **`preventDefault()`**: Prevents the default behavior of the event. For example, prevent a form **from submitting**.
  
  ```javascript
  form.addEventListener("submit", function(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    console.log("Form submission prevented.");
  });
  ```

- **`stopPropagation()`**: Stops the event from propagating (bubbling or capturing).
  
  ```javascript
  element.addEventListener("click", function(event) {
    event.stopPropagation();
    console.log("Event propagation stopped.");
  });
  ```

## Custom Events
You can create and dispatch your own events using the `CustomEvent` constructor.

```javascript title="Example: Creating and Dispatching Custom Events"
// Create a custom event
const myEvent = new CustomEvent('myCustomEvent', {
  detail: { message: 'Hello from custom event!' },
});

// Add a listener
document.addEventListener('myCustomEvent', (e) => {
  console.log(e.detail.message);
});

// Dispatch the event
document.dispatchEvent(myEvent);
```
