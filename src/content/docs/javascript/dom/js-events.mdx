## What Are Events?

:::note
- Events are **actions** or **occurrences** that happen in the browser, such as a user clicking a button, typing in a form, or the page finishing loading.
- JavaScript allows developers to **listen** for and **respond** to various **user actions** or **other events**, such as clicks, mouse movements, key presses, or page loading. 
- This is done using **event listeners (or handlers)**, which are functions that **are executed** when a specific event occurs.
- Events are a core part of JavaScript programming, enabling developers to create **interactive** and **dynamic** web applications.
:::


### Types of Events
Here are some common event types:
- **Mouse events**: Click, mouseover, mouseout, mousedown, mouseup, etc.
- **Keyboard events**: keydown, keyup, keypress
- **Form events**: submit, change, input, focus, blur
- **Document events**: load, DOMContentLoaded, resize, scroll
- **Media events**: play, pause, ended, volumechange
- **Other events**: touch events, focus, and blur events

:::tip
Each event represents a state change in the browser or user interface.

## Event Handlers: What Are They?

:::note
An **event handler** is a function that gets called when a specified event occurs. It's a **callback function** that you associate with a particular event on an HTML element or a JavaScript object.

## Adding Event Listeners
---
There are three main ways to add **event handlers** to an element in JavaScript:

### 1. Inline Event Handler 
Inline event handling involves **adding** event handler code directly to HTML elements as **event attributes**. This approach is generally **not recommended** due to maintainability issues.

```html
<button onclick="alert('Button clicked!')">Click Me</button>
```

### 2. Using the `onclick` Property 
- This method allows setting **a function** as an **event handler** for an element. 
- If there is already an event handler assigned using `onclick`, it **will be overwritten** by a new one.

```javascript
const button = document.querySelector("button");
button.onclick = function() {
  alert("Button clicked!");
};
```

### 3. Using the `addEventListener()` 
:::danger[Note]
- The `addEventListener()` method is the **preferred modern approach** for attaching event handlers. 
- It offers more flexibility and allows **multiple event listeners** for the same event type.
:::

**Syntax:**
```javascript
element.addEventListener(event, function, useCapture);
```

- `event`: The name of the event (e.g., "click", "keydown").
- `function`: The callback function to be executed when the event occurs.
- `useCapture` (optional): A boolean that specifies whether the event should **be captured** during the capturing phase (`true`) or the bubbling phase (`false`, default).


**Example:** of using `addEventListener` to handle a button click event:

```javascript 
const element = document.getElementById("elementId");
element.addEventListener("click", function() {
  alert("Element clicked!");
});
```
## How `addEventListener()` Works?

1. **`element`**: This refers to a specific DOM (Document Object Model) element on the web page, like a button, a div, or any HTML element you can interact with. You would typically get this element using methods like `document.getElementById()`, `document.querySelector()`, etc.

2. **`addEventListener`**: This is a method that attaches an event handler (a function) to the specified element. It listens for an event (like a mouse click, key press, etc.) and runs a function when that event happens.

3. **`'event'`**: This is a string that specifies the type of event you're listening for. Common events include:
   - `'click'`: Triggered when the element is clicked.
   - `'mouseover'`: Triggered when the mouse pointer is over the element.
   - `'keydown'`: Triggered when a key is pressed down.
   - `'submit'`: Triggered when a form is submitted.

4. **`function`**: This is the **callback function** that will run when the event occurs. The function contains the code you want to execute when the event is triggered. It **can be an anonymous** function, like:
   ```js
   function() {
       console.log("Element clicked!");
   }
   ```
   Or a named function, like:
   ```js
   function handleClick() {
       console.log("Element clicked!");
   }
   ```

| `mouseover`                 | Fired when the mouse pointer hovers over an element or its child elements.       |
