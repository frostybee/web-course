:::note
- **Regular expressions**, often abbreviated as **regex** or **regexp**, are **patterns used to match character combinations in strings**.
- They are useful for searching, validating, extracting, or replacing text.
- A **regular expression** is a **sequence** of **characters** that defines a **search pattern**.
:::

### üß† How DoThey Work?
---
A regular expression defines a **pattern**. That pattern is then compared to a **target string**, and based on the rules, it either:
- **Matches** the pattern (success),
- Or **doesn't match** (failure).

## Why Use Regular Expressions?
---
* **Validation**: Email addresses, phone numbers, passwords
* **Text extraction**: Pulling data from **unstructured** text
* **Search and Replace**: Complex **find/replace** operations
* **Text Processing**: Cleaning, transforming, and parsing text
* **Data Scraping**: Extracting specific information from documents


## üìê Regex Patterns
---
### Basic Regex Patterns

| Character | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `.` | Matches any character except newline |
| `\d` | Matches any digit (0-9) |
| `\w` | Matches any word character (**alphanumeric** + **underscore**) |
| `\s` | Matches any whitespace character |
| `\D`, `\W`, `\S` | **Negated** versions (non-digit, non-word, non-whitespace) |

### Quantifiers
---
| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `*` | 0 or more times |
| `+` | 1 or more times |
| `?` | 0 or 1 time (optional) |
| `{n}` | Exactly n times |
| `{n,}` | n or more times |
| `{n,m}` | Between n and m times |

## Character Classes
---
* Square brackets **`[ ]`** define a **character class**.
* Match any single character from the **specified set**.
* **Examples:**
  * `[aeiou]` - matches any vowel
  * `[0-9]` - matches any digit (same as `\d`)
  * `[a-zA-Z]` - matches any letter (upper or lowercase)
  * `[^0-9]` - matches any character that's NOT a digit

### Groups and Ranges
---
| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `(abc)` | Capturing group |
| `(?:abc)` | Non-capturing group |
| `[abc]` | a, b, or c |
| `[^abc]`| Not a, b, or c |
| `[a-z]` | Range (lowercase) |
| `[A-Z]` | Range (uppercase) |

### Alternation

```js
/yes|no/
```
Matches either `"yes"` or `"no"`



### Anchors and Boundaries
---
| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `^` | Start of string or line |
| `$` | End of string or line |
| `\b` | Word boundary |
| `\B` | Not a word boundary |

### üö© Regex Flags/Modifiers
---
| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `g`  | Global search (find all matches) |
| `i`  | Case-insensitive search |
| `m`  | Multi-line mode (`^` and `$` match line start/end) |
| `s`  | Allows `.` to match newline characters |
| `u`  | Unicode mode |
| `y`  | Sticky search (matches from lastIndex) |

**Example:**
```js
const regex = /hello/gi;
```

## Groups and Capturing

* Parentheses `( )` create capture groups
* Used to:
  * Apply quantifiers to entire sequences
  * Extract specific parts of the match
  * Reference matched text with backreferences

```
# Example: Capturing name parts
pattern = r"(\w+)\s(\w+)"
text = "John Smith"
# Captures: Group 1 = "John", Group 2 = "Smith"
```

## Alternation and Non-capturing Groups

* `|` pipe symbol for alternation (OR operator)
* `(?:...)` for non-capturing groups
* Examples:
  * `cat|dog` matches "cat" or "dog"
  * `I love (cats|dogs)` matches "I love cats" or "I love dogs"
  * `(?:https?|ftp)://` matches "http://", "https://", or "ftp://"
  
## Lookahead and Lookbehind

* **Lookahead**: `(?=...)` positive, `(?!...)` negative
* **Lookbehind**: `(?<=...)` positive, `(?<!...)` negative
* Zero-width assertions (don't consume characters)
* Examples:
  * `\w+(?=\s)` - word followed by whitespace
  * `(?<=\$)\d+` - digits preceded by dollar sign
  * `\b\w+\b(?!\s+and\b)` - word NOT followed by "and"
