## Understanding the Basics of Fonts in CSS

- [Serif Vs Sans Serif and How to Choose Them](https://creatypestudio.co/serif-vs-sans-serif/)
- [What Font Should I Use?](https://drmarkwomack.com/a-writing-handbook/style/typography/)

:::note
- In CSS, fonts are **primarily controlled** through the **`font-family`**, **`font-size`**, and other related properties. 

- A **font family** refers to a **group of fonts** that are related to each other, often with variations in weight, style, and size.

- There are multiple techniques you can use to create **readable**, **visually appealing** text. 

- By **combining font families** with properties like font size, weight, line height, and letter spacing, you can ensure that your typography adapts well across **different devices** and **screen sizes**.

## Font Classification
Fonts are classified into the following generic font families:
1. **Serif Fonts:** Fonts **with small lines** at the ends of characters (e.g., Times New Roman).
2. **Sans-serif Fonts:** Fonts without these lines (e.g., Arial, Helvetica).
3. **Monospace Fonts:** Each character takes up the **same amount of space** (e.g., Courier New).
4. **Cursive Fonts:** Fonts with a handwritten or slanted style (e.g., Comic Sans MS).
5. **Fantasy Fonts:** Decorative fonts (e.g., Impact).
:::tip
In CSS, you can define font families using either predefined **web-safe fonts** or **custom fonts** hosted on external servers.

## Font Basics in CSS

The `font-family` property is used to specify the font for the text within an element. Fonts are typically defined by specifying **a generic font family**,  **a system font**, or **a web font**.

### Basic Font Declaration Syntax

```css
selector {
    font-family: "Font Name", fallback-font, generic-font;
}
```
- `selector`: The CSS selector (e.g., body, h1, .class, #id, etc.).
- `font-family`: The CSS property used to specify the font.

### Font-Family List
You can define a **list** of **font names**, which is helpful if a userâ€™s system **doesn't have** the first font. CSS will try each font in the list in order until it finds one available on the user's system.

```css
body {
    font-family: "Helvetica", "Arial", sans-serif;
}
```

In the example above:
- `"Helvetica"` is the preferred font.
- If `"Helvetica"` is unavailable, the browser will try `"Arial"`.
- If neither font is available, the browser will **fall back** to the **generic** `sans-serif` font.

### Generic Font Families
CSS has a set of **[generic font families](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-family)** that can be used as **fallbacks**:
- `serif`: Fonts with small lines or extensions at the end of the strokes (e.g., Times New Roman).
- `sans-serif`: Fonts without serifs (e.g., Arial).
- `monospace`: Fonts where each character takes up the same width (e.g., Courier New).
- `cursive`: Fonts that resemble handwritten or calligraphic styles (e.g., Comic Sans MS).
- `fantasy`: Decorative fonts (e.g., Impact).

## Using Web Safe Fonts

**Web-safe fonts** are fonts that are commonly **installed on most devices**. These include fonts like Arial, Times New Roman, and Courier New. Because these fonts are ubiquitous, you **can safely** use them in web design without worrying about compatibility.

### Example with Web-Safe Fonts:

```css
body {
  font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;
}
```

Web-safe fonts ensure consistent typography across different platforms, as they are available on most operating systems. However, relying solely on web-safe fonts can **limit your design choices**, which is why **custom fonts are often preferred**.

## Custom Fonts with `@font-face`

If you want to use a specific font that may not be available on the user's device, you can use the `@font-face` rule to load a custom font from a **URL** or **local file**.

**Syntax:**

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'MyCustomFont';
  src: url('path-to-font.woff2') format('woff2'),
       url('path-to-font.woff') format('woff');
}
```

- **font-family:** The name you want to assign to your custom font.
- **src:** Specifies the location of the font file.

### Example:
```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'OpenSans';
  src: url('/assets/fonts/OpenSans-Regular.woff2') format('woff2'),
       url('/assets/fonts/OpenSans-Regular.woff') format('woff');
}

body {
  font-family: 'OpenSans', sans-serif;
}
```

This method ensures that the font will be downloaded from the server and used across all browsers, as long as the font files are properly hosted.

## Google Fonts Integration

**Google Fonts** is a free and open-source collection of fonts that can be easily integrated into your website. The fonts are optimized for fast loading and can be added to your website using a `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section.

### Steps:
1. Visit [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) and choose a font.
2. Copy the `<link>` tag provided.
3. Paste the `<link>` tag into the `<head>` section of your HTML document.
4. Use the font in your CSS.

### Example:

1. Link to Google Fonts in HTML:

```html
<head>
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
```

2. Use the font in CSS:

```css
body {
  font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
}
```
