## What is the CSS display property? 

:::note
- The `display` property in CSS is used to define the **display behavior** of an element on a web page. 
- It determines how an element should be displayed within **the document flow** and how it interacts with other elements.
:::

**Here are some of the most common values for the `display` property:**

1. **`block`**: The element takes up the **full width available**, starting on a new line. Examples include `<div>`, `<p>`, and `<h1>`.
   
2. **`inline`**: The element takes up only **as much width as it needs** and does not start on a new line. Examples include `<span>`, `<a>`, and `<strong>`.

3. **`inline-block`**: Combines features of both `block` and `inline`. The element behaves like an inline element (doesn't start on a new line) but allows **setting width and height** like a block-level element.

4. **`none`**: The element **is not displayed** at all. It is removed from the document flow, and no space is reserved for it. This is commonly used for hiding elements.

5. **`flex`**: This makes the element a **flex container**, allowing you to use **flexbox** to manage the layout of its children. It enables dynamic alignment and distribution of items within the container.

6. **`grid`**: This makes the element a **grid container**, enabling you to use CSS Grid Layout to create two-dimensional layouts with rows and columns.

7. **`inline-flex`**: Similar to `flex`, but the container behaves like an inline element (not breaking onto a new line).

8. **`inline-grid`**: Similar to `grid`, but the container behaves like an inline element.
