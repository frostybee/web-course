## What Is the CSS Box Model?

## Components of the CSS Box Model

The box model consists of **four main components**, from the inside out:

1. **Content**: 
   - This is the **actual content** of the box, such as text, images, or other media. It is the **innermost part** of the box and defines the size of the element's core area.
   - You can control the **size** of the content box using properties like **`width`** and **`height`**.

2. **Padding**:
   - Padding is the **space between** the **content and the border**. It provides inner spacing within the box to ensure the content doesn't touch the border directly.
   - Padding is **transparent** and can be adjusted individually for each side: **`padding-top`**, **`padding-right`**, **`padding-bottom`**, and **`padding-left`**.

3. **Border**:
   - The border surrounds the padding (if any) and content. It can have a width, color, and style (e.g., solid, dotted, dashed).
   - You can style the border using properties like **`border-width`**, **`border-style`**, and **`border-color`**.

4. **Margin**:
   - The margin is the outermost space around the border, separating the element from other elements on the page.
   - Margins are **transparent**, and like padding, they can be adjusted on each side: **`margin-top`**, **`margin-right`**, **`margin-bottom`**, and **`margin-left`**.
   - The margin also helps with **positioning** and **spacing between** elements.
