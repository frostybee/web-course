## What Are CSS Units?

- [CSS units](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Values_and_units#lengths) are used to specify the **measurements** for sizes, **lengths**, positions, and other properties on a webpage.
- **Fixed units** and **relative units** are two broad categories of these units, each serving distinct purposes. 

## Using CSS Units: Syntax
To specify a unit in CSS, you simply follow the **property name** with **a value**, and **then append** the appropriate unit. Here's the basic syntax:

```css
property: value unit;
```

### Example:
```css
font-size: 16px;  /* 16 pixels */
width: 5cm;       /* 5 centimeters */
margin: 1in;      /* 1 inch */
line-height: 1.5pt; /* 1.5 points */
```

- **property**: The CSS property (e.g., `border-width`, `font-size`, `width`, `margin`, etc.)
- **value**: The numerical value (e.g., `16`, `5`, `1.5`)
- **unit**: The unit of measurement (e.g., `px`, `cm`, `in`, `pt`)

**Note:** Each unit corresponds to a specific measurement, and you use them based on what you're trying to style (like sizing, spacing, or positioning).

## Fixed Units

Fixed units are used when you want to define **precise measurements**, regardless of the surrounding elements or viewport size. These units **do not change** based on the context in which they are used.
Common examples of fixed units include:

### Pixels (px)
- The pixel (**px**) is the most widely used **fixed unit**. It represents a **single point** on the screen (a pixel) and **is not affected** by the size of the screen or viewport. This makes it an ideal choice for specifying **exact sizes**.
- **Use cases**:
  - Setting precise element sizes (e.g., widths, heights).
  - Defining **padding** and **margins**.
  - Font size when you want consistent text size across all devices.

The following table contains all the CSS fixed units. They are considered fixed units because they don't adjust **relative to other elements** or screen sizes.

| **Unit**  | **Description**                                       | **Example**        |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| **px**    | Pixels, relative to the display resolution.           | `16px`             |
| **cm**    | Centimeters, based on the physical size of the display. | `5cm`              |
| **mm**    | Millimeters, based on the physical size of the display. | `10mm`             |
| **in**    | Inches, based on the physical size of the display.    | `2in`              |
| **pt**    | Points, 1 point is 1/72 of an inch.                   | `12pt`             |
| **pc**    | Picas, 1 pica is 12 points.                          | `3pc`              |
