## What Are CSS Media Queries?
---

:::note
- CSS Media queries let you **apply specific CSS rules** to a webpage **based on certain conditions**, like the characteristics of the **device displaying** the content, such as the viewport width, height, screen resolution, the **size of the screen**, device type, or even whether it's being viewed in **portrait** or **landscape** mode. 
- They allow you to create **adaptive layouts**, adjust content based on device characteristics, and ensure that users have a smooth experience no matter what device they are using.
:::

## Basic Syntax of Media Queries
---

The basic syntax of a CSS media query is:

```css
@media [media-type] and (condition) {
  /* CSS rules */
}
```

- **`@media`**: The keyword that starts the media query.
- **`[media-type]`**: Optional. Specifies the type of device (screen, print, etc.).
- **`and`**: Combines multiple conditions (optional).
- **`(condition)`**: Specifies the condition for the query (e.g., max-width, min-height, width of the viewport, resolution, orientation).

### Example:

In the following example, the background color of the body will change to light blue only if the viewport width is 600px or smaller.

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  body {
    background-color: lightblue;
  }
}
```

## Common Use Cases of Media Queries
---
:::tip
1. **Responsive Layouts:** Change the number of columns or layout structure based on **screen size** (e.g., one column for small screens and multiple columns for larger screens).
2. **Font size adjustments:** Adjust font sizes for readability on various devices.
3. **Visibility of elements:** Show or hide specific elements depending on the device (e.g., a mobile-friendly menu might be hidden on desktop and shown on mobile).
4. **Orientation-based styles:** Adjust the layout when the device is in **portrait** or **landscape** orientation.

## Types of Media Features

Media queries can target various media features. Some of the most commonly used features include:

### 1. **Width and Height**
   - **`width`**: The width of the viewport (or device screen).
   - **`height`**: The height of the viewport (or device screen).

### 2. **Min-width and Max-width**
   - **`min-width`**: Specifies the minimum width of the viewport.
   - **`max-width`**: Specifies the maximum width of the viewport.

These are the **most commonly used features** for responsive design, allowing you to target devices based on their screen size.

### 3. **Orientation**
   - **`orientation`**: Defines whether the device is in portrait or landscape mode.

   ```css
   @media (orientation: portrait) { ... }
   @media (orientation: landscape) { ... }
   ```

### 4. **Resolution**
   - **`resolution`**: Specifies the resolution of the device, which is useful for high-DPI (dots per inch) screens like Retina displays.

   ```css
   @media (min-resolution: 192dpi) { ... }
   ```

### 5. **Aspect Ratio**
   - **`aspect-ratio`**: Specifies the aspect ratio of the device’s screen.

   ```css
   @media (max-aspect-ratio: 16/9) { ... }
   ```

## Media Query Ranges

You can use `min-width` and `max-width` to create responsive ranges that define the different breakpoints for different screen sizes. This technique is often used in responsive web design to ensure your layout adapts at specific intervals.

### Example:

```css
/* Styles for small screens */
@media (max-width: 600px) {
  body {
    background-color: lightblue;
  }
}

/* Styles for medium screens */
@media (min-width: 601px) and (max-width: 1024px) {
  body {
    background-color: lightgreen;
  }
}

/* Styles for large screens */
@media (min-width: 1025px) {
  body {
    background-color: lightcoral;
  }
}
```

## Using Media Queries with CSS

You can write media queries directly within a CSS file, or you can include them in an external stylesheet. Below is an example of a media query applied within a CSS file:

```css
/* Default styles for larger screens */
body {
  font-size: 18px;
  background-color: lightgray;
}

/* Styles for smaller screens */
@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  body {
    font-size: 14px;
    background-color: lightblue;
  }
}
```

In the above example, the body font size and background color change depending on the screen width.

## Best Practices for Media Queries

### 1. **Mobile-First Approach**
   - Start by designing your layout for the smallest devices first, and then use media queries to adapt it for larger devices.
   - Example:
     ```css
     body {
       font-size: 14px;
     }

     /* Larger screens */
     @media (min-width: 600px) {
       body {
         font-size: 18px;
       }
     }
     ```

### 2. **Minimize Breakpoints**
   - Use as few breakpoints as possible to keep the CSS maintainable.
   - Start with basic ranges (e.g., 600px, 1024px) and refine from there if needed.

### 3. **Avoid Overloading Styles**
   - Don’t define styles in every media query unless necessary; instead, override only the properties that need adjusting.

### 4. **Use Relative Units**
   - Use relative units (e.g., `em`, `rem`, `vw`, `vh`) for font sizes, margins, paddings, etc., to make your layout more flexible.

## Examples of Media Queries

Here are some examples of common media queries used in responsive web design:

### 1. **Mobile-First Design**
```css
/* Mobile-first styles */
body {
  font-size: 14px;
  background-color: lightgray;
}

@media (min-width: 600px) {
  body {
    font-size: 16px;
    background-color: lightgreen;
  }
}

@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  body {
    font-size: 18px;
    background-color: lightblue;
  }
}
```

### 2. **Portrait vs. Landscape Orientation**
```css
@media (orientation: portrait) {
  .sidebar {
    display: block;
  }
}

@media (orientation: landscape) {
  .sidebar {
    display: none;
  }
}
```

### 3. **High-DPI Devices (Retina Displays)**
```css
@media only screen and (min-resolution: 192dpi) {
  img {
    max-width: 100%;
    height: auto;
  }
}
```

## Combining Multiple Media Queries
---
You can also combine multiple media queries using the `and`, `or`, and `not` operators to create more specific conditions.

### Example:
```css
@media screen and (max-width: 800px) and (orientation: landscape) {
  body {
    background-color: lightgreen;
  }
}
```
