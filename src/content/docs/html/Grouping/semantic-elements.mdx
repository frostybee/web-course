:::note
- HTML5 introduced new **semantic elements** to improve the structure and **meaning** of web pages.
- These elements provide better accessibility, SEO benefits, and clearer code, helping both developers and search engines better understand the page structure. 
- By replacing generic elements like `<div>` and `<span>` with more descriptive tags, you can create clearer, more organized web pages that are both easier to maintain and more comprehensible to search engines and assistive technologies.

## Understanding Semantic Elements

[Semantic elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics) are HTML tags that describe the **meaning** of the content enclosed. These tags provide context to the browser and search engines, helping them understand the structure of the webpage. 

### Examples of Semantic Tags:
- `<header>`: Represents introductory content, such as a logo, navigation bar, or header text.
- `<footer>`: Represents footer content, often including copyright information, links, or contact details.
- `<article>`: Represents independent content, like a blog post or news article.
- `<section>`: Represents a section of content that can be thematically grouped.
- `<nav>`: Represents navigation links for the website or a part of it.
- `<aside>`: Represents content that is indirectly related to the main content (like **sidebars**).
- `<main>`: Represents the main content of the document (unique to a page).
- `<figure>`: Represents content such as images, illustrations, diagrams, etc., and is often paired with a `<figcaption>`.
- `<mark>`: Represents highlighted or marked text.
- `<details>`: Represents content that can be toggled open or closed, like a dropdown or FAQ section.
- `<summary>`: Represents a summary or heading for a `<details>` element.
- `<time>`: Represents a specific time or date.

## Using HTML5 Semantic Elements

### Basic Structure of HTML5 Semantic Elements

Hereâ€™s an example of a basic HTML5 page structure utilizing semantic elements:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>HTML5 Semantic Page</title>
</head>
<body>

    <header>
        <h1>Website Title</h1>
        <nav>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
                <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
                <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
    </header>

    <main>
        <article>
            <header>
                <h2>Article Title</h2>
                <p>By Author | Date</p>
            </header>
            <section>
                <h3>Section Title</h3>
                <p>This is some content inside the section.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Another Section</h3>
                <p>This is more content inside another section.</p>
            </section>
        </article>

        <aside>
            <h3>Related Content</h3>
            <p>This is some additional, related content.</p>
        </aside>
    </main>

    <footer>
        <p>&copy; 2024 Your Website. All rights reserved.</p>
    </footer>

</body>
</html>
```

### **`<header>`**
- The `<header>` element represents introductory content, usually at the top of the page. It can contain elements like logos, navigation bars, and introductory text.
- **Example**:
  ```html
  <header>
      <h1>My Website</h1>
      <nav>
          <ul>
              <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
              <li><a href="#services">Services</a></li>
          </ul>
      </nav>
  </header>
  ```

### `<footer>`
- The `<footer>` element typically contains footer information like copyright notices, legal disclaimers, and contact links.
- **Example**:
  ```html
  <footer>
      <p>&copy; 2024 Your Company. All rights reserved.</p>
  </footer>
  ```

### `<main>`
- The `<main>` element represents the main content of the document. There should only be one `<main>` element per page, and it should contain content that is directly related to the central topic.
- **Example**:
  ```html
  <main>
      <article>
          <h2>Blog Post Title</h2>
          <p>This is the main content of the blog post.</p>
      </article>
  </main>
  ```

### `<article>`
- The `<article>` element is used for self-contained content that could be reused or syndicated (like a blog post, news article, or forum post).
- **Example**:
  ```html
  <article>
      <header>
          <h2>Title of Article</h2>
          <p>Written by Author | Date</p>
      </header>
      <p>This is the content of the article.</p>
  </article>
  ```

### `<section>`
- The `<section>` element represents a distinct section of content, usually with a heading. It can be used to break content into logical parts.
- **Example**:
  ```html
  <section>
      <h3>Section Heading</h3>
      <p>This is the content inside this section.</p>
  </section>
  ```

### `<nav>`
- The `<nav>` element contains navigation links. It is typically used to group links for major sections of the site.
- **Example**:
  ```html
  <nav>
      <ul>
          <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
          <li><a href="#services">Services</a></li>
          <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
      </ul>
  </nav>
  ```

### `<aside>`
- The `<aside>` element contains content that is  only indirectly related to the main content, such as sidebars, related links, or advertisements.
- **Example**:
  ```html
  <aside>
      <h3>Related Articles</h3>
      <p>Check out these related articles.</p>
  </aside>
  ```

### `<figure>` and `<figcaption>`
- The `<figure>` element is used for content like images, charts, and videos. The `<figcaption>` element is used to provide a caption for the content.
- **Example**:
  ```html
  <figure>
      <img src="image.jpg" alt="A beautiful view">
      <figcaption>A caption describing the image.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  ```

### `<mark>`
- The `<mark>` element is used to highlight parts of text, often used for search results or key information.
- **Example**:
  ```html
  <p>Search results for <mark>HTML5</mark> are highlighted here.</p>
  ```

### `<details>` and `<summary>`
- The `<details>` element is used to represent a collapsible section, while `<summary>` provides the heading for the toggleable section.
- **Example**:
  ```html
  <details>
      <summary>Click to view details</summary>
      <p>This is some additional content that can be revealed.</p>
  </details>
  ```

### `<time>`
- The `<time>` element is used to represent a specific date or time.
- **Example**:
  ```html
  <p>The event will be held on <time datetime="2024-12-31">December 31, 2024</time>.</p>
  ```

## Best Practices for Using Semantic HTML

:::tip
- **Structure Content Meaningfully**: Use semantic tags to give meaning to different sections of your page. For instance, don't just use `<div>` for everything. Use `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, etc., where appropriate.  
- **Use `<main>` Once**: The `<main>` element should be used once per document. It should not contain elements like `<header>` or `<footer>`, as they belong to the outer structure of the page.  
- **Accessibility**: Semantic tags improve accessibility by providing screen readers with better context. Make sure to also add ARIA roles and other accessibility attributes when necessary.
- **SEO Benefits**: Search engines can index pages better when semantic elements are used properly, improving your site's visibility.
