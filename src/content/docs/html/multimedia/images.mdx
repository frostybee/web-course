## Basic Image Syntax
:::note
- The HTML **`<img>`** element is the foundation for **embedding images** in web pages. 
- It is a **self-closing element**, meaning it doesn't require a closing tag.
- The basic syntax requires **two key attributes:**
:::

```html
<img src="image_source" alt="image_description">
```
- **`src`**: Specifies the image source (URL or path).
- **`alt`**: Provides **alternative text** for accessibility and cases where the image fails to load.

---

## Image Sources
### Relative Paths
Use **relative paths** when referencing images **within** your **project structure**: The image file is in the **same directory** or a **subdirectory** of your HTML file
```html
<img src="images/photo.jpg" alt="Local image">
<img src="../images/photo.jpg" alt="Image in parent directory">
```

### Absolute Paths (URL)
External images require complete URLs: The image is hosted on a different domain or server.
```html
<img src="https://example.com/images/photo.jpg" alt="External image">
```

## Essential Attributes

### Width and Height
You can control the size of an image using the `width` and `height` attributes or via CSS.
```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Sized image" width="800" height="600">
```

### Loading Behavior
Control image loading for performance optimization:
```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Lazy loaded image" loading="lazy">
```

The `loading` attribute accepts three values:
- `eager`: Load immediately (default)
- `lazy`: Defer loading until near viewport
- `auto`: Browser determines loading strategy


## Common Image Formats

There are various image formats that HTML supports, each suited for different types of images:

- **JPEG (.jpg or .jpeg)**: Best for photographs or images with many colors. Supports lossy compression.
- **PNG (.png)**: Best for images that require transparency or images with sharp edges (e.g., logos).
- **GIF (.gif)**: Used for animations or images with fewer colors.
- **SVG (.svg)**: Scalable vector graphic, used for logos and icons that can scale without losing quality.
- **WebP (.webp)**: A modern format offering both lossless and lossy compression with smaller file sizes.
