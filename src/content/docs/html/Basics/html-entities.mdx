>HTML entities are **special codes** used to represent characters that have a specific meaning in HTML syntax or that cannot be directly typed into HTML code (such as symbols, non-ASCII characters, or **reserved characters**).


> HTML entity references help ensure that your web pages display the intended characters without interfering with the HTML document structure.

## What Are HTML Entities?

HTML entities are text strings that begin with an ampersand (`&`) and end with a semicolon (`;`). They represent characters that are either difficult or impossible to type directly into HTML or have special meanings within the language. HTML entities can represent:

- **Reserved characters**: Such as `<`, `>`, `&`, which are used to define HTML syntax.
- **Special symbols**: Like copyright (`©`) or trademark (`™`).
- **Non-ASCII characters**: For characters not part of the standard ASCII set, such as accented characters (é, ñ) or non-Latin scripts.
- **Invisible (whitespace) characters**: For formatting purposes, like non-breaking spaces (`&nbsp;`).

## Types of HTML Entity Reference

HTML entities follow a specific structure:
:::note
1. **Named Entities**: These have a descriptive name, e.g., `&amp;` for the ampersand symbol (`&`).
2. **Numeric Entities**: These use either **decimal** or **hexadecimal** notation to represent a character, e.g., `&#169;` for the copyright symbol or `&#xA9;` in hexadecimal notation.
:::

#### Examples:
- **`&lt;`** → `<`
- **`&gt;`** → `>`
- **`&amp;`** → `&`
- **`&quot;`** → `"`
- **`&copy;`** → `©`
- **`&#169;`** → `©` (decimal)
- **`&#xA9;`** → `©` (hexadecimal)

## How to Use HTML Entities

HTML entities can be used anywhere in the content of an HTML document. Here's how to include them properly:

### Basic Syntax:
```html
<p>This is an example of using an entity: &lt;div&gt;Hello&lt;/div&gt;</p>
```

In the example above:
- The `<div>` tags are replaced by `&lt;div&gt;` and `&lt;/div&gt;` to avoid them being interpreted as HTML tags.

### Named Entities:
```html
<p>John &amp; Jane are friends.</p>
```
- The `&amp;` will display as an ampersand (`&`) in the rendered page.

### Numeric Entities (Decimal and Hexadecimal):
```html
<p>The copyright symbol is &#169; or &#xA9;.</p>
```
- Both decimal (`&#169;`) and hexadecimal (`&#xA9;`) entities will display the copyright symbol (`©`).

## Why Use HTML Entities?
Entities are primarily used to:
- **Prevent HTML parsing conflicts**: Characters like `<`, `>`, and `&` have specific functions in HTML and need to be represented as entities to avoid confusion.
- **Display special symbols and characters**: Some characters, such as the copyright symbol or accented characters, are not easily typed on a standard keyboard or may not be supported across all encodings.
- **Improve compatibility**: Ensuring your HTML content renders correctly across different devices, browsers, and platforms.
