## Hyperlinks States

:::note
- The `<a>` element (used to define hyperlinks) has **different "states"** that describe its interaction with the user. 
- These **states** are typically **controlled using CSS pseudo-classes**, which define the appearance of links under **different conditions** and based on **user interaction**. 
:::

The following link states can be styled using CSS to provide visual feedback to users during interaction with links.

| **Link State**          | **CSS Pseudo-class** | **Description**                                                                                                                                 | **Example**                                                                                                                                       |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Normal State**         | `a`                  | This is the **default state** of a link before any interaction.                                                                                     | `<a href="https://example.com">Click Here</a>`                                                                                                     |
| **Hovered State**        | `a:hover`            | Activated when the user **hovers over** the link, typically used to indicate interactivity.                                                        | `a:hover { color: blue; }`                                                                                                                        |
| **Visited State**        | `a:visited`          | This state represents a link that the user has already **clicked and visited**. Often styled to show the user that they have previously interacted.  | `a:visited { color: purple; }`                                                                                                                     |
| **Active State**         | `a:active`           | Triggered when the link is **being clicked or activated**. It lasts only for the duration of the click.                                               | `a:active { color: red; }`                                                                                                                       |
| **Focus State**          | `a:focus`            | Indicates that the link **has received focus**, such as when a user navigates to it using the keyboard (e.g., tabbing).                             | `a:focus { outline: 2px solid blue; }`                                                                                                          |


## Styling Link States

Link states are decorated using CSS pseudo-classes and can be customized with different styles to give the user **visual feedback** about the link's state.

### CSS Pseudo-classes

:::tip
1. **`:link`** – This state applies to links that have not yet been visited by the user.   
2. **`:visited`** – This state applies to links that the user has already clicked and visited.   
3. **`:hover`** – This state applies when the user hovers their mouse over the link.
4. **`:active`** – This state applies when the link is being clicked (actively pressed by the user).
5. **`:focus`** – The link is focused (e.g., selected by the user through mouse click or keyboard navigation).
:::

## Example
Styling links in different states:
```css
/* Unvisited links */
a:link {
    color: blue;
    text-decoration: none;
}

/* Visited links */
a:visited {
    color: purple;
}

/* Mouse over links */
a:hover {
    color: red;
    text-decoration: underline;
}

/* Active/clicked links */
a:active {
    color: orange;
}
/* Focused links */
a:focus {
    color: yellow;    
}
```
