## What Are Hyperlinks?
:::note
- Hyperlinks (or simply "links") allows users to **navigate between pages** and **resources** on the web. 
- Links are created using the **`<a>`** (anchor) element, which stands for **"anchor"**.
:::

## Basic Link Syntax
Links in HTML are created using the `<a>` (anchor) element. The most important attribute is `href`, which specifies the **destination** of the link.

```html
<a href="absolute URL|relative path|#elementID"> Link content </a>
```
- `<a>`: The anchor element that defines the link.
- `href`: The attribute that specifies the destination URL (Uniform Resource Locator), relative path, or fragment (element ID) of the link.
- `Link content`: The **clickable area** that users will see on the webpage. The content may consist of  text, a mixture of text and other HTML elements, or just other HTML elements.

**Example:**
```html
<a href="https://www.example.com">Click here to visit Example</a>
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always use descriptive link text.** Make sure your link text is descriptive so that **users** and **search engines** **can understand** its purpose.
   - Good: `<a href="products.html">View our product catalog</a>`
   - Bad: `<a href="products.html">Click here</a>`

2. Include **title attribute** for additional context:
   ```html
   <a href="product.html" title="View detailed product specifications">
     Product Details
   </a>
   ```

3. **Make links accessible:**
   - Use sufficient color contrast
   - Ensure links are recognizable (underlined or distinctly colored)
   - Add `aria-label` attribute for screen readers when needed:
     ```html
     <a href="pdf.html" aria-label="Download annual report (PDF, 2MB)">
       Annual Report
     </a>
     ```

4. **Use appropriate security measures for external links:**
   ```html
   <a href="https://external-site.com" 
      target="_blank" 
      rel="noopener noreferrer">
     External Site
   </a>
   ```
5. **Link Testing**: Regularly test your links to ensure they are not broken or leading to outdated pages.
