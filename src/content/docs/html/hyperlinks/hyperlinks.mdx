## What Are Hyperlinks?
:::note
- Hyperlinks (or simply "links") allows users to **navigate between pages** and **resources** on the web. 
- Links are created using the **`<a>`** (anchor) element, which stands for **"anchor"**.
- The `<a>` element can link to another webpage, a specific section of the current page, an external website (or resource), a file, or even an email address.
:::

## Basic Link Syntax
Links in HTML are created using the `<a>` (anchor) element. The most **important attribute** is **`href`**, which specifies the **destination** of the link.

```html
<a href="absolute URL|relative path|#elementID"> Link content </a>
```
:::tip
- `<a>`: The anchor element that defines the link.
- `href`: The attribute that specifies the destination URL (Uniform Resource Locator), relative path, or fragment (element ID) of the link.
- `Link content`: The **clickable area** that users will see on the webpage. The content may consist of  text, a mixture of text and other HTML elements, or just other HTML elements.
:::

**Example:**
```html
<a href="https://www.example.com">Click here to visit Example</a>
```

## Types of Links

### 1. Linking to Other Pages within Your Website

If you want to link to another page within your website, you can simply use a **relative path** (that is, partial URL). This is especially **useful for navigation** within your site.

```html
<a href="/about.html">About Us</a>
```

- The link points to `about.html` relative to the root directory of your site.

---

### 2. Linking to External Websites

To link to an external website, you just need to use the **full URL** (starting with `http://` or `https://`).

```html
<a href="https://www.wikipedia.org">Visit Wikipedia</a>
```
- When clicked, this link will open Wikipedia in the same tab.

---

### 3. Linking to Specific Sections on the Same Page (Anchor Links)

You can create links that jump to **specific sections** on the **same page**. This is done using the **`id`** attribute.

1. **First, add an `id` to the target section:**
    ```html
    <h2 id="intro-section">Introduction</h2>
    <p>This is the introduction to the page.</p>
    ```

2. **Then, create a link to that section:**
    ```html
    <a href="#intro-section">Go to Introduction</a>
    ```

- Clicking on the link will scroll to the section with the `id="intro-section"`.

---

### 4. **Mailto Links (Email Links)**

You can create links that allow users to send an email by using the **`mailto:`** scheme.

```html
<a href="mailto:someone@example.com">Send Email</a>
```

- When clicked, this will open the user's default email client with the email address pre-filled.

---

### 5. Phone Number Links (tel Links)

Similar to mailto links, you can create links that dial a phone number by using the **`tel:`** scheme.

```html
<a href="tel:+1234567890">Call Us</a>
```

- When clicked on **mobile devices**, this will initiate a call to the specified phone number.

---

### 6. Linking to Files (Downloads)

You can link to files such as PDFs, images, or other downloadable content using a simple `<a>` tag.

```html
<a href="files/example.pdf" download>Download PDF</a>
```

The **`download`** attribute suggests that the file should be downloaded rather than opened in the browser.

## Best Practices

1. **Always use descriptive link text.** Make sure your link text is descriptive so that **users** and **search engines** **can understand** its purpose.
   - Good: `<a href="products.html">View our product catalog</a>`
   - Bad: `<a href="products.html">Click here</a>`   

2. Include **title attribute** for additional context:
   ```html
   <a href="product.html" title="View detailed product specifications">
     Product Details
   </a>
   ```
3. **Make links accessible:**
   - Use sufficient color contrast
   - Ensure links are recognizable (underlined or distinctly colored)
   - **Add `aria-label` attribute for screen readers when needed:**
     ```html
     <a href="pdf.html" aria-label="Download annual report (PDF, 2MB)">
       Annual Report
     </a>
     ```
4. **Use appropriate security measures for external links:**
   ```html
   <a href="https://external-site.com" 
      target="_blank" 
      rel="noopener noreferrer">
     External Site
   </a>
   ```
5. **Link Testing**: Regularly test your links to ensure they are not broken or leading to outdated pages.
