## What are HTML Elements?
HTML elements are the fundamental building blocks of a web page. They define the structure and content of the page, such as text, images, links, tables, forms, and more.   

HTML elements are categorized into **two** main **categorizes**: 
1. **Two-sided Elements**: Enclose content and must have both an **opening tag** and a **closing tag**.
2. **One-sided Elements**: Do not require a closing tag and are also known as **void**, or self-closing elements.

### 1. Two-Sided HTML Elements (Also Known as **Container Elements** or **Paired Tags**)

**Definition**: Two-sided elements are HTML elements that require both an opening tag and a closing tag. These tags work in pairs: the opening tag defines the start of the element, and the closing tag marks the end of the element.

#### Syntax:
```html
<opening-tag>Content goes here</closing-tag>
```

Where the opening tag and the closing tag are the same, but the closing tag includes a forward slash (`/`) before the tag name. The content between these tags represents the content of the element.

#### Example:
```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```
- `<p>`: The opening tag.
- `</p>`: The closing tag.

#### Common Two-Sided Elements:

- **Text Formatting Elements**:
  - `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<b>`, `<i>`, `<u>`, etc.
- **Structural Elements**:
  - `<div>`, `<section>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`, etc.
- **List Elements**:
  - `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`, etc.
- **Form Elements**:
  - `<form>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<label>`, `<select>`, etc.
- **Media Elements**:
  - `<audio>`, `<video>`, `<figure>`, etc.

#### Characteristics:
- **Requires Closing Tag**: You must use both the opening and closing tags to ensure the element functions correctly in HTML. 
- **Contains Content**: These elements can contain other HTML elements or text content between the tags.
- **Nested**: You can nest two-sided elements inside one another. The nesting order must be properly maintained for the HTML to be valid.

#### Example with Nesting:
```html
<div>
  <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph inside a div element.</p>
</div>
```
